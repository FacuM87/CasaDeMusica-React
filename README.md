# Project Summary
"Casa de MÃºsica" is an eCommerce platform entirely developed with React JS. <br>
The following libraries were used for its development and optimization:
<br>
<br>
- React -> https://es.react.dev/
- React Router -> https://reactrouter.com
- React Form -> https://www.react-hook-form.com/
- React Spinners -> https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners || https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/
- React Toastify -> https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/
- React Lottie -> https://lottiefiles.com/
<br>
The site's styling is partially based on <strong>Bootstrap v5.3</strong>, and <strong>FontAwesome</strong> icons have been incorporated into the project.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, both the product information displayed on the screen and the purchase orders generated by the app are stored in <strong>Firebase</strong>, used as a cloud database. Access to <strong>Firestore</strong> is done through asynchronous processes generated from the site.

The deployment was done on <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>, and you can access to it from <a href="https://proyecto-final-mingorance.vercel.app/">HERE</a>.

# About the libraries used:

### React Router: 
Responsible for project routing.

### React Form: 
With React Hook Form, form management is simplified. The use of the "useForm" hook allows access to higher levels of abstraction, summarizing registration and validation
processes in a few lines of code, making it lighter and easier to read.

### React Spinners: 
A simple library providing a variety of spinners for use in our app as customizable components.

### React Toastify: 
Used to notify whenever a product has been successfully added to the cart.

### React Lottie: 
This library makes it easier to implement high-quality, lightweight, and scalable animations through a .JSON file.

# Possible future implementations:

- Payment system
- User registration
